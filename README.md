## About
The purpose of this tool is to generate story ideas! 
The generated story will be split into its respective 
plot points. The method of generation used is POCL 
(Partial Order Causal Link), where a story outcome is 
chosen, and then the story works backwards to make 
a logical story out of it.

This generator can also be used as a fantasy name generator!
A fantasy name generator is built into the fantasy genre for 
cohesiveness. I recommend putting Genre Intensity up to 1.0 
if this is your goal.

## Parameters

### Stats
Stats will affect story outcomes, with high bravery and strength often 
resulting in successful encounters in the Fantasy and Horror genres.

### Genre
Genre will significantly change the tone of the story by restricting 
word choice to genre-specific language. Story outcomes are also affected 
by this parameter, which changes the plot points it can generate.

### Genre Intensity
This value affects how strictly the story draws from the genre-specific 
word pool. Values less than 1.0 (the maximum value) will sometimes fall 
back to the neutral language set.

### Descriptiveness
This value determines the likelihood of adjectives and adverbs 
appearing throughout the story (while still following grammar 
rules).

## Limitations

The biggest limitation with the tool is variety. Each genre 
only has about three possible endings, and words are drawn 
from a small pool, so outputs can feel a bit repetitive.
